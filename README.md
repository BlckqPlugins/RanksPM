# RanksPM

**This is an RankSystem for PM4. 
To use this ranking system, you need at least one vServer.
We will also soon add a small update so that a vServer is no longer required.
Note: The plugin does not work with API 3.0.0 but only with API 4.0.0.**

Plugin files will be saved in this directory: **/home/data/Rank/**
