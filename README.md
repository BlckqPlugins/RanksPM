# RanksPM

**This is an RankSystem for PM4. 
To use this ranking system, you do not need a vServer.
Note: The plugin does not work with API 3.0.0 but only with API 4.0.0.**

Plugin files will be saved by default in this directory: **plugin_data/RanksPM/data/Rank/**

_To activate MultiServer Support you have to set **"global" in "config.yml" from 'false' to 'true'**._
